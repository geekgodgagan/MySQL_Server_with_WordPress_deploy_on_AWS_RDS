# MySQL_Server_with_WordPress_deploy_on_AWS_RDS
## What I have done
ðŸ”… Create an AWS EC2 instance

ðŸ”… Configure the instance with Apache Webserver.

ðŸ”… Download php application name "WordPress".

ðŸ”… As wordpress stores data at the backend in MySQL Database server. Therefore, you need to setup a MySQL server using AWS RDS service using Free Tier.

ðŸ”… Provide the endpoint/connection string to the WordPress application to make it work.

This command.txt file contains the commands used during the above process.
